# MCP Streamable HTTP client support — Design

**Status:** Design — not yet implemented. Adds the MCP **Streamable HTTP**
transport (`type: "http"`) to `McpClient`, and flips the three ACP gates that
were deliberately left rejecting `http` until the client could dispatch it.
Per the maintainer's **2026-07-01 decision (D2)**, a bare `url` now *defaults*
to Streamable HTTP (SSE becomes opt-in via `type: "sse"`) — a deliberate
**breaking change**; see §3 D2 and §10.

**Audience:** Agentao maintainers; the DeepChat/TensorChat ACP integration owner.

**Companion:** `mcp-streamable-http.zh.md`.

**Related:**
- `docs/reference/configuration.md` — MCP config schema (`§ MCP`, transport table).
- `project_mcp_connect_preflight` (PR #71) — the content-type preflight this
  design reuses unchanged; it was already written transport-agnostic.
- `project_opencode_pull_review_20260629` (PR #119) — `resolve_timeouts`
  split (startup/request) that both URL transports already share.
- `embedding-vs-acp.md` — ACP is a frontend over the embedded core; the
  transport dispatch lives in the runtime, ACP only translates config.

**Method:** every claim below is anchored to source at `main`@`8bcb1b1`. MCP SDK
surfaces (`sse_client`, `streamablehttp_client`) were introspected from the
installed `mcp` package, not recalled. No intuition mappings.

---

## 1. Background — how transport is chosen today

`McpClient` (`agentao/mcp/client.py`) recognizes exactly two transports, and it
infers them **structurally** from which config key is present — there is no
explicit transport selector in native `.agentao/mcp.json`:

```python
# client.py:152-158
@property
def transport_type(self) -> str:
    if self.config.get("command"):
        return "stdio"
    if self.config.get("url"):
        return "sse"
    return "unknown"

# client.py:183-188  (inside connect())
if self.config.get("command"):
    await self._connect_stdio()
elif self.config.get("url"):
    await self._connect_sse(startup_timeout, request_timeout)
else:
    raise ValueError("No transport configured ... (need 'command' or 'url')")
```

- `_connect_stdio` (232-255) → `stdio_client`.
- `_connect_sse` (318-353) → `sse_client`, runs `_preflight_content_type`
  (257-316), applies `startup` as the HTTP-open timeout and raises
  `sse_read_timeout` to cover a large per-request budget.
- Timeouts are pre-resolved once by `resolve_timeouts` (`config.py:87-124`),
  which is **already transport-neutral** — its docstring literally says the
  legacy int "is handed to the SSE transport" but the semantics ("bound the
  connect/startup phase") apply verbatim to Streamable HTTP.
- `call_tool` (355-441) retries once on `SESSION_EXPIRED` / `TRANSPORT_DROPPED`
  per `classify_mcp_error` (85-99).

**The ACP layer already uses an explicit `type` field** — and already anticipates
this work by rejecting `http` in three places, each with a comment that says
"remove this when the client learns Streamable HTTP":

| Gate | Location | Current behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Capability advertised | `acp/initialize.py:75-78` | `mcpCapabilities = {"http": False, "sse": True}` |
| `session/new` parser | `acp/session_new.py:226-232` | `type` must be `stdio`\|`sse`; `http` → `INVALID_PARAMS` |
| ACP→native translator | `acp/mcp_translate.py:189, 232-244` | `http` entry logged + dropped (defensive backstop) |

So the config vocabulary (`type: "stdio" | "sse" | "http"`) is **already
established in-tree** on the ACP side. This design brings the native config and
the client up to the same vocabulary and connects the wire.

## 2. The gap and why now

The MCP spec **deprecated the HTTP+SSE transport** (2024-11-05) in favor of
**Streamable HTTP** (2025-03-26). New remote MCP servers ship Streamable HTTP;
many expose *only* it. Agentao can currently reach them only if they also keep a
legacy SSE endpoint. The client dependency is already present —
`mcp.client.streamable_http.streamablehttp_client` ships in the pinned
`mcp>=1.26.0` SDK — so this is a wiring task, not a new dependency.

## 3. Design decisions

### D1 — Transport selector is an explicit `type` field

Native `.agentao/mcp.json` gains an optional `type` per server:
`"stdio" | "sse" | "http"`. Accept `"streamable-http"`, `"streamable_http"`,
`"streamablehttp"` as case-insensitive aliases that normalize to `"http"`.

**Why `type`:** it is already the ACP wire vocabulary (`acp/mcp_translate.py:189`)
*and* the broad ecosystem convention (Claude Code `.mcp.json`, VS Code, Cursor
all key remote transport on `type`/`transport`). Reusing it keeps one vocabulary
across the native config, the ACP boundary, and the outside world — no third
dialect to reconcile.

### D2 — `type`-absent default is Streamable HTTP (bare `url` → `http`)

**Decided by the maintainer (2026-07-01).** When `type` is omitted, `url` →
**`http` (Streamable HTTP)**; `command` → `stdio` is unchanged. SSE is retained
but becomes **opt-in** via `type: "sse"`. A bare `{"url": "..."}` now means
Streamable HTTP.

**Why:** the MCP spec deprecated HTTP+SSE in favor of Streamable HTTP; new
servers ship http-first (Cursor already made a bare `url` mean Streamable HTTP).
Defaulting to the live transport is what most new configs will want and keeps
agentao aligned with the spec's direction rather than pinned to a deprecated
transport.

**Accepted cost — this is a breaking change.** Every existing bare-`url` config
that pointed at an SSE endpoint now attempts Streamable HTTP and will fail the
handshake until `"type": "sse"` is added. The maintainer owns this call (a
product-direction decision — cf. the project's "pain judgment is the user's"
rule). Two mitigations keep the break **loud, not silent**:

1. **Actionable connect error (§5.7).** When a connection made on the *inferred*
   http default (bare `url`, no explicit `type`) fails the handshake, the error
   appends: *"tried as Streamable HTTP (the default for a bare `url`); if this is
   a legacy SSE endpoint, set `\"type\": \"sse\"`."* The one-token fix travels
   with the failure.
2. **Release-note migration line (§10).**

**Alternative considered and rejected — auto-fallback** (try Streamable HTTP,
fall back to SSE on 405/404). Rejected: it contradicts agentao's
explicit-over-magic posture — the very preflight this design reuses is an
*allow-list*, deliberately not content-sniffing (`client.py:113-119`).
Auto-fallback also makes `transport_type` nondeterministic (breaks `/mcp list`
status + `get_server_status`), doubles the connect latency budget on the miss
path, and muddies which transport an error came from. Legacy SSE users write
`type: "sse"` — one token.

### D3 — One transport resolver, and it **fails closed**

Add `resolve_transport(config) -> str` to `config.py` as the single source of
truth. `McpClient.transport_type` and `connect()` both call it — the ad-hoc
`command?/url?` ladders (152-158, 183-188) collapse into one dispatch on its
return. Contract:

1. **Explicit `type` present** — normalize (lowercase + alias fold), then:
   - in `{stdio, sse, http}` → return it;
   - **anything else → raise `McpTransportConfigError`** (a `ValueError`
     subclass) with an actionable message listing the accepted values.
2. **Explicit `type` absent** — apply the D2 inference: `command` → `stdio`,
   `url` → `http`, neither → `"unknown"` (which `connect()` turns into the
   existing "No transport configured" error).
3. **Required-key check (both branches)** — once a concrete transport is chosen,
   the key it needs must be present: `stdio` needs `command`, `sse`/`http` need
   `url`. A mismatch (`{"type":"stdio","url":...}`, `{"type":"http","command":...}`)
   **raises `McpTransportConfigError`**, not a downstream `KeyError`.

**Why fail-closed, unlike `_coerce_timeout`'s warn-and-default (Finding 1).**
A bad timeout falls back to a *safe* default — a slightly-wrong number. A bad
*transport* is categorically different: under D2 a typo like `"type": "see"`
would, under warn-and-infer, silently resolve to Streamable HTTP (the bare-`url`
default) and connect to the **wrong protocol** — the exact class of silent
misroute the whole design is built to avoid. The ACP side already fails closed
here (`session_new.py:227-232` rejects unknown `type` with `INVALID_PARAMS`);
native config must match that posture, not undercut it.

**Keeping the status path total.** `resolve_transport` raising would make the
`transport_type` property (used for `/mcp list` + `get_server_status`, which must
never throw) unsafe. So the property swallows the error for *display only* —
`try: return resolve_transport(...) except McpTransportConfigError: return
"unknown"` — while `connect()` lets it propagate into its existing `except`
(212), which records the actionable message in `error_message`. Net: status
shows `transport=unknown` + the real reason in the error column; the connect
attempt fails closed with a clear message; nothing silently misroutes.

## 4. Config surface

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-http":    { "type": "http", "url": "https://host/mcp",
                        "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer $TOKEN" } },
    "remote-default": { "url": "https://host/mcp" },        // no type → Streamable HTTP (D2)
    "remote-sse":     { "type": "sse",  "url": "https://host/sse" },  // opt into legacy SSE
    "local":          { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "server"] }
  }
}
```

Resolution table (`resolve_transport`):

| config | result |
|---|---|
| `type:"stdio"` + `command` | stdio |
| `type:"sse"` + `url` | SSE |
| `type:"http"` (or aliases) + `url` | **Streamable HTTP (new)** |
| no `type`, `command` present | stdio |
| no `type`, `url` present | **Streamable HTTP** (D2 default) |
| no `type`, no `command`/`url` | `"unknown"` → connect raises "No transport configured" |
| `type` present but not stdio/sse/http | **raise `McpTransportConfigError`** (fail closed, Finding 1) |
| chosen transport's required key missing (`type:"http"` w/o `url`, `type:"stdio"` w/o `command`) | **raise `McpTransportConfigError`** (fail closed, Finding 3) |

`http` and `sse` are **URL-shaped and identical in every field** (`url`,
`headers`, `timeout`, `trust`) — only the client factory differs. That symmetry
is what lets §5 share almost all code.

## 5. Client changes (`agentao/mcp/client.py`)

### 5.1 Imports — use the **canonical** client, not the deprecated alias

```python
from mcp.client.streamable_http import (
    create_mcp_http_client,
    streamable_http_client,
)   # add
```

The pinned SDK (`mcp` 1.26.0, the pin floor) ships **two** functions:
`streamablehttp_client` is `@deprecated("Use streamable_http_client instead.")`
and emits a `DeprecationWarning` on every connect; `streamable_http_client` is
the canonical replacement. We import the canonical one (both exist at 1.26.0, so
no pin bump). The trade-off is a small API difference (§5.3): the canonical
function takes a pre-built httpx client instead of `headers`/`timeout`/
`sse_read_timeout` kwargs — we build that client with the SDK's own
`create_mcp_http_client` factory (also exported from this module), which is
exactly what the deprecated wrapper did internally.

The SDK is already imported eagerly at module top (`from mcp.client.sse import
sse_client`, line 14); Streamable HTTP is the same package, so no new lazy-load
concern — `agentao.mcp/__init__.py`'s PEP-562 gate already defers the whole SDK
until `McpClientManager` is first touched.

### 5.2 `transport_type` and dispatch → delegate to `resolve_transport`

The property is for *display* and must never throw (`get_server_status`,
`/mcp list`), so it swallows the fail-closed error to `"unknown"`; the real
message is surfaced by `connect()` instead (D3):

```python
@property
def transport_type(self) -> str:
    try:
        return resolve_transport(self.config)     # "stdio" | "sse" | "http" | "unknown"
    except McpTransportConfigError:
        return "unknown"                          # actionable reason rides error_message
```

`connect()` calls the *raising* resolver so a bad `type` / missing required key
fails closed through the existing `except` at 212 (which sets `error_message`):

```python
# connect()
transport = resolve_transport(self.config)        # raises McpTransportConfigError, caught by connect's except
if transport == "stdio":
    await self._connect_stdio()
elif transport == "sse":
    await self._connect_sse(startup_timeout, request_timeout)
elif transport == "http":
    await self._connect_streamable_http(startup_timeout, request_timeout)
else:  # "unknown" — no type and no command/url
    raise ValueError(
        f"No transport configured for server '{self.name}' "
        f"(need 'command', or 'url' with type 'sse'/'http')"
    )
```

Because `resolve_transport` has already validated the required key (D3 step 3),
`_connect_stdio`'s `self.config["command"]` (234) and the URL transports'
`self.config["url"]` are guaranteed present — no downstream `KeyError`.

### 5.3 The structural differences — client-building + tuple arity

Introspection of the pinned SDK (verified, not recalled):

- `sse_client(url, headers=, timeout=, sse_read_timeout=)` yields
  **`(read_stream, write_stream)`** — 2-tuple.
- `streamable_http_client(url, *, http_client=None, terminate_on_close=True)`
  yields **`(read_stream, write_stream, get_session_id)`** — 3-tuple; the third
  element is a callable returning the negotiated `Mcp-Session-Id` (or `None`).
  It takes a **pre-built httpx client** (not header/timeout kwargs), and when
  the caller supplies one the SDK does **not** manage its lifecycle.

So `_connect_streamable_http` differs from `_connect_sse` in three ways:
(1) build the httpx client via `create_mcp_http_client` (headers + a
`httpx.Timeout(startup, read=sse_read_timeout)` — the same mapping the deprecated
wrapper used); (2) enter that client into the exit stack **before** the transport
so the LIFO unwind tears the transport down (its session-terminate `DELETE`)
while the client is still open, then closes the client; (3) unpack a 3-tuple, not
a 2-tuple:

```python
async def _connect_streamable_http(self, startup_timeout, request_timeout):
    import httpx
    url, headers, sse_read_timeout = await self._prepare_url_connect(startup_timeout, request_timeout)
    http_client = create_mcp_http_client(
        headers=headers or None,
        timeout=httpx.Timeout(startup_timeout, read=sse_read_timeout),
    )
    await self._exit_stack.enter_async_context(http_client)   # caller-managed lifecycle
    transport = await self._exit_stack.enter_async_context(
        streamable_http_client(url, http_client=http_client, terminate_on_close=True)
    )
    read_stream, write_stream, _get_session_id = transport   # 3-tuple, not 2
    self._session = await self._exit_stack.enter_async_context(
        ClientSession(read_stream, write_stream)
    )
```

### 5.4 Factor the shared URL-connect preamble

`_connect_sse` and `_connect_streamable_http` share four steps verbatim: read
`url`/`headers`, compute `sse_read_timeout` (raise-only vs
`_DEFAULT_SSE_READ_TIMEOUT`, client.py:332-336), run `_preflight_content_type`,
then enter the transport CM. Extract the first three into a tiny helper
`_prepare_url_connect(startup, request) -> (url, headers, sse_read_timeout)`
(which also runs the preflight) so the two `_connect_*` methods differ only by
one line: the client factory and the tuple unpack.

**The preflight needs no change.** `_preflight_content_type` (257-316) already
allow-lists `application/json` + `text/event-stream` and its docstring/error
already name "Streamable HTTP" — it was written transport-agnostic in PR #71.
A Streamable HTTP endpoint that answers the HEAD/GET probe with `application/json`
or `text/event-stream` passes; one that 405s the probe returns non-2xx and passes
through to the real handshake (client.py:302-303). Confirmed against the existing
`test_mcp_preflight.py` logic — no allow-list edit required.

### 5.5 Timeouts — same semantics as SSE

`resolve_timeouts` is transport-neutral. `startup` becomes the httpx client's
connect timeout (`httpx.Timeout(startup, read=...)` fed to
`create_mcp_http_client`), `sse_read_timeout` becomes its read timeout (the
raise-only rule vs `_DEFAULT_SSE_READ_TIMEOUT` is unchanged), and `request`
bounds each `call_tool` via `read_timeout_seconds` exactly as for SSE
(client.py:368-371). Update the one wording nit in `config.py:100-103` ("handed
to the SSE transport") to "handed to the URL transport (SSE or Streamable
HTTP)".

### 5.6 Error classification / reconnect — v1 leaves it, with a watch-item

Streamable HTTP session expiry surfaces server-side as **HTTP 404 on the
`Mcp-Session-Id`**. The existing `SESSION_EXPIRED` markers (client.py:51-59:
"session expired/not found/unknown session/session terminated") catch the *text*
forms the SDK raises, and `TRANSPORT_DROPPED` + the reconnect-once loop
(372-402) already cover a dropped long-poll stream. A **bare** `404` with no
session wording is intentionally **not** added to `SESSION_EXPIRED`: `404` is far
too broad (a genuine tool-not-found would loop into a reconnect storm). Per the
project's "watch-item, not speculative fix" convention (cf.
`project_codex_pull_review_20260614`), v1 ships the existing rules and we add a
targeted marker *only if* a real Streamable HTTP server is observed emitting a
text-less 404 on expiry. Documented here so the next reader knows it was a
decision, not an oversight.

### 5.7 Connect-failure hint for the inferred http default (D2 mitigation)

D2 makes a bare `url` mean Streamable HTTP, which breaks configs that used a
bare `url` to reach a legacy SSE server. To keep that break loud, `connect()`
enriches the failure on the inferred path. Two guards keep the hint accurate:

1. **Inferred-only** — `url` present and `type` absent (the user did not
   explicitly choose http). `resolve_transport` already distinguishes "explicit
   http" from "inferred http"; thread that one bit (e.g.
   `resolve_transport(config, return_source=True) -> (transport, "explicit"|"inferred")`,
   or a sibling `transport_is_inferred(config)` predicate) into the `except`, so
   the hint fires for `{"url": ...}` but **not** for an explicit
   `{"type": "http", ...}` (where SSE is not the likely intent).
2. **Not the non-MCP verdict (Finding 4)** — skip the hint when the error is a
   `NonMcpEndpointError`. That exception is the preflight's "this is a web page,
   not MCP at all" verdict (`client.py:102-110`) and already carries its own
   actionable message; appending "set `type:\"sse\"`" on top would wrongly imply
   the endpoint is a legacy SSE server when it isn't MCP at all. The hint is for
   *handshake/transport* failures — where SSE-vs-HTTP is a plausible cause — not
   for a content-type rejection.

```python
except Exception as e:
    self.error_message = str(e)
    if (
        transport == "http"
        and _url_transport_was_inferred(self.config)
        and not isinstance(e, NonMcpEndpointError)   # Finding 4: don't override the non-MCP verdict
    ):
        self.error_message += (
            "  (tried as Streamable HTTP — the default for a bare 'url'; "
            "if this is a legacy SSE endpoint, set \"type\": \"sse\".)"
        )
    ...
```

Low-noise (fires only on an actual connect failure, never on stdio/sse/explicit
http, never on a non-MCP-content-type verdict) and high-value (the one-token fix
rides along the failures where it actually applies).

## 6. ACP changes — flip the three gates

All three were written to reject `http` *because the client couldn't dispatch
it*. §5 removes that reason, so each gate opens. Update the docstrings that
explain the rejection in the same edit (they will otherwise lie —
cf. the "comment lies" watch-items in `project_hermes_pull_review_20260629`).

1. **`acp/initialize.py:75-78`** — `mcpCapabilities = {"http": True, "sse": True}`.
   Update the docstring at 24-26 and the inline comment at 70-74.
2. **`acp/session_new.py:226-232`** — accept `"http"` in the type set. The
   URL-field validation branch is already `else: # http or sse` (line 248), so
   only the guard set at 227 widens: `("stdio", "sse", "http")`. Fix the
   docstring at 204-210.
3. **`acp/mcp_translate.py:217-244`** — the `sse` branch becomes
   `elif transport_type in ("sse", "http")` and, **critically, stamps the
   explicit transport into the produced cfg for _both_ URL transports**:

   ```python
   elif transport_type in ("sse", "http"):
       ...
       cfg = {"url": url, "type": transport_type}   # always stamp — both ways
       ...
   ```

   The stamp is **mandatory in both directions** under D2's http default: an ACP
   `sse` entry that produced a bare `{"url": ...}` would be read back by
   `resolve_transport` as *http* (the new default) and connect to the wrong
   transport — the exact inverse of the pre-flip hazard. Stamping the explicit
   `type` makes the translation independent of whatever the native default is,
   so it stays correct across any future default change. Update the module
   docstring at 63-69 and the dropped-branch comment at 233-237 (the `else` now
   only catches genuinely unknown types).

## 7. CLI change (`agentao/cli/commands/mcp.py`)

`/mcp add` currently writes `{"url": endpoint}` for any `http(s)://` endpoint
(53-54) — always SSE. Flip the flag-less URL default to Streamable HTTP (to
match D2) and add a `--sse` opt-out:

```
/mcp add <name> <url>                            # → { "type": "http", "url": ... }  (D2 default)
/mcp add --sse  <name> <url>                     # → { "type": "sse",  "url": ... }  (opt into legacy SSE)
/mcp add --http <name> <url>                     # explicit http (same as flag-less)
/mcp add <name> <command> [args...]              # stdio (unchanged)
```

Parse a leading `--sse`/`--http` flag off `sub_args`. Write the **explicit**
`type` in every URL case — flag-less and `--http` both write
`{"type": "http", "url": endpoint}`; `--sse` writes `{"type": "sse", ...}`.
Writing the type explicitly (rather than a bare `url`) makes the saved config
survive any future default change. Update the usage/example block (44-48) to
lead with the Streamable HTTP form.

## 8. Docs

- `docs/reference/configuration.md` — the transport table (197-198) gains a
  **Streamable HTTP** row: `url` (+ optional `type: "http"`) required key,
  `headers` / `timeout` / `trust` optional; and a short note that **bare `url` =
  Streamable HTTP (D2 default)** while `type: "sse"` opts into legacy SSE. Update
  the timeout bullet at 202 ("SSE HTTP-connection open" → "URL-transport HTTP
  open"). Add the §10 migration note near the transport table.
- `config.py` `McpServerConfig` docstring (14-32) — add the `type` key and a
  "Streamable HTTP transport" stanza mirroring the "SSE transport" one.
- `CLAUDE.md` § MCP — the transport list ("`command` (stdio subprocess) or `url`
  (SSE)") becomes "`command` (stdio) or `url` (Streamable HTTP by default; add
  `type: "sse"` for the legacy SSE transport)".

## 9. Test plan

New `tests/test_mcp_streamable_http.py`:

- `resolve_transport` happy rows: every valid row of the §4 table incl. alias
  normalization (`streamable-http`/`streamable_http`/case).
- `resolve_transport` **fail-closed** (Findings 1 & 3):
  - explicit-but-unknown `type` (`"see"`, `"streamable"`, `""`) → raises
    `McpTransportConfigError` — **it does not silently become http**;
  - required-key mismatch (`{"type":"http"}` w/o `url`, `{"type":"stdio"}` w/o
    `command`, `{"type":"http","command":...}` w/o `url`) → raises;
  - `transport_type` *property* returns `"unknown"` (never raises) for all of the
    above, while `connect()` records the actionable message in `error_message`.
- Dispatch: `connect()` routes both `type:"http"` **and bare `url` (no type)**
  to `_connect_streamable_http` (monkeypatch `streamablehttp_client` to a fake
  3-tuple CM), while `type:"sse"` routes to `_connect_sse` — **the D2 default
  assertion (bare `url` = http).**
- §5.7 hint gating: a bare-`url` handshake failure appends the SSE hint; an
  explicit `type:"http"` failure does **not**; an SSE failure does not; **and a
  bare-`url` `NonMcpEndpointError` (HTML page) does not** (Finding 4 — the
  non-MCP verdict is not overridden with an SSE suggestion).
- 3-tuple unpack: the fake yields `(read, write, get_session_id)`; assert the
  session is built and the callback is not required.
- Timeouts: `streamablehttp_client` receives `timeout=startup` and the
  raised `sse_read_timeout` (reuse `test_mcp_connect_timeouts.py` fixtures).
- Preflight reuse: a Streamable HTTP endpoint returning `application/json`
  passes; `text/html` raises `NonMcpEndpointError` (extend
  `test_mcp_preflight.py`).

Update existing:

- `test_acp_initialize.py:89`, `test_acp_schema.py:113/145/168` — expected
  `mcpCapabilities` flips to `{"http": True, "sse": True}`.
- `test_acp_session_new.py:335` (+ its `http`-rejection case) — `http` now parses.
- `test_acp_mcp_injection.py` — add an `http` entry asserting the translated cfg
  carries `"type": "http"` (the §6.3 stamp).

## 10. Rollout, non-goals, future

**Rollout — breaking change (D2).** Bare `url` flips from SSE to Streamable
HTTP, so this is **not** backward-compatible for URL servers. Land as one PR
(client + ACP + CLI + docs + tests) since the ACP gates are meaningless to flip
without the client, and pointless to leave rejecting once the client lands.
Verify the merged tree runs green before merge (cf. "never merge red CI").

**Migration line (release notes / CHANGELOG):** *"MCP: a bare `url` server now
defaults to the Streamable HTTP transport. If your server is a legacy SSE
endpoint, add `\"type\": \"sse\"` to its entry in `.agentao/mcp.json`. Streamable
HTTP is the spec's replacement for the now-deprecated HTTP+SSE transport."* The
§5.7 connect-failure hint surfaces the same fix in-context for anyone who misses
the note.

**Non-goals (v1):**
- Surfacing/using the `Mcp-Session-Id` (the discarded 3rd tuple element) or
  explicit session resumption — the reconnect-once loop is sufficient.
- OAuth/`auth=` on `streamablehttp_client` — headers (incl. `Bearer $TOKEN` via
  env expansion) cover the current bearer-token case; interactive OAuth is a
  separate, larger design.
- Auto-fallback (the D2 alternative that was rejected).
- A one-time *runtime deprecation warning* on every bare-`url` config. Rejected
  as noisy — it would fire even for the now-correct http case. The §5.7
  on-failure hint is the targeted substitute; the §10 migration line covers the
  broad announcement.

## 12. Commit checklist

Dependency-ordered — each stage compiles/tests on top of the previous, so an
implementer can work top-to-bottom and the PR bisects cleanly. Line anchors are
`main`@`8bcb1b1`. The whole thing lands as **one PR** (§10); the stages below can
be separate commits within it.

### Stage 0 — baseline

- [ ] Branch `feat/mcp-streamable-http` off `main`.
- [ ] Record green baseline: `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q` (note the count;
      the merged tree must be ≥ baseline + new tests, all green — never merge red
      CI).
- [ ] (Already verified, re-confirm on the target machine) the pinned SDK:
      `streamablehttp_client` yields a **3-tuple** and accepts
      `terminate_on_close` — `uv run python -c "import inspect,mcp.client.streamable_http as m; print(inspect.signature(m.streamablehttp_client))"`.

### Stage 1 — `agentao/mcp/config.py` (foundation, no in-tree deps)

- [ ] Add `class McpTransportConfigError(ValueError)`.
- [ ] Add `resolve_transport(config, *, return_source=False) -> str`
      implementing D3: lowercase + alias-fold `type`
      (`streamable-http`/`streamable_http`/`streamablehttp` → `http`); **raise
      `McpTransportConfigError`** on an explicit-but-unknown `type`; D2 inference
      when absent (`command`→stdio, `url`→http, else `"unknown"`); **required-key
      validation** (stdio needs `command`, sse/http need `url`) → raise on
      mismatch. With `return_source=True`, also return `"explicit"|"inferred"`
      for the §5.7 hint (or expose a sibling `transport_is_inferred(config)`).
- [ ] Extend the `McpServerConfig` docstring (14-32): add the `type` key and a
      "Streamable HTTP transport" stanza mirroring the "SSE transport" one.
- [ ] Reword the `resolve_timeouts` docstring (100-103): "handed to the SSE
      transport" → "handed to the URL transport (SSE or Streamable HTTP)".

### Stage 2 — `agentao/mcp/client.py`

- [ ] `from mcp.client.streamable_http import streamablehttp_client` (top, by
      the `sse_client` import at 14).
- [ ] `transport_type` property → `try: return resolve_transport(self.config)
      except McpTransportConfigError: return "unknown"` (never raises — status
      path stays total).
- [ ] `connect()` (183-190): dispatch on the **raising** `resolve_transport`;
      keep the "No transport configured" `ValueError` for the `"unknown"` case.
- [ ] Extract `_prepare_url_connect(startup, request) -> (url, headers,
      sse_read_timeout)` (url/headers read + `sse_read_timeout` raise-only calc
      at 332-336 + `_preflight_content_type`); refactor `_connect_sse` (318-353,
      **2-tuple**) to use it.
- [ ] Add `_connect_streamable_http` using the helper +
      `streamablehttp_client(..., timeout=startup, sse_read_timeout=...,
      terminate_on_close=True)` + **3-tuple unpack**
      `read, write, _get_session_id = transport`.
- [ ] §5.7 hint in `connect()`'s `except` (211-221): append the
      set-`type:"sse"` hint **only when** `transport == "http"` **and** the
      transport was inferred **and** `not isinstance(e, NonMcpEndpointError)`.
- [ ] Leave `classify_mcp_error` / `_ERROR_RULES` unchanged (§5.6 watch-item).

### Stage 3 — ACP (flip the three gates; fix the docstrings so they don't lie)

- [ ] `acp/initialize.py`: `mcpCapabilities` (75-78) → `{"http": True, "sse":
      True}`; update the docstring (24-26) and inline comment (70-74).
- [ ] `acp/session_new.py`: accept `"http"` in the type guard (227); fix the
      `_parse_mcp_servers` docstring (204-210) that says http is rejected.
- [ ] `acp/mcp_translate.py`: `elif transport_type in ("sse", "http")` (217);
      `cfg = {"url": url, "type": transport_type}` — **stamp both** (§6.3); update
      the module docstring (63-69) and the dropped-branch comment (233-237).

### Stage 4 — CLI `agentao/cli/commands/mcp.py`

- [ ] `/mcp add` (41-69): parse a leading `--sse`/`--http` off `sub_args`;
      flag-less + `--http` URL → `{"type": "http", "url": endpoint}`, `--sse` →
      `{"type": "sse", "url": endpoint}` (write the explicit `type`, not a bare
      `url`). Update the usage/example block (44-48) to lead with the http form.

### Stage 5 — docs & release note

- [ ] `docs/reference/configuration.md`: Streamable HTTP transport row (197-198);
      timeout bullet (202) wording; the §10 migration note near the table; state
      bare `url` = Streamable HTTP, `type:"sse"` for legacy SSE.
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` § MCP: transport line → "`command` (stdio) or `url` (Streamable
      HTTP by default; add `type:"sse"` for legacy SSE)".
- [ ] CHANGELOG / release notes: the **BREAKING** migration line from §10.

### Stage 6 — tests

- [ ] New `tests/test_mcp_streamable_http.py` — all §9 cases: `resolve_transport`
      happy rows + **fail-closed** (unknown `type`, required-key mismatch, property
      returns `"unknown"`); dispatch (`type:"http"` **and bare `url`** →
      `_connect_streamable_http`, `type:"sse"` → `_connect_sse`); 3-tuple unpack;
      timeouts; **§5.7 hint gating incl. the `NonMcpEndpointError` skip**;
      preflight reuse.
- [ ] `tests/test_acp_initialize.py:89` → `{"http": True, "sse": True}` (the real
      advertised-value assertion).
- [ ] `tests/test_acp_schema.py:113` (and 145/168 for consistency) → flip the
      inline `mcpCapabilities` fixture to `{"http": True, "sse": True}`.
- [ ] `tests/test_acp_session_new.py` — flip the `http`-**rejection** case
      (docstring ref at 335) to a `http`-**accept** case.
- [ ] **`tests/test_acp_mcp_injection.py:437`** — the SSE-translation assertion
      `{"remote": {"url": "https://x/sse", "trust": False}}` now also carries
      `"type": "sse"` (fallout of §6.3 stamping *both* transports); add an `http`
      entry asserting the `"type": "http"` stamp.

### Stage 7 — verify (fail-closed self-review, per the grep-first ethos)

- [ ] Full suite green: `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q`.
- [ ] Targeted: `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_*.py tests/test_acp_*.py -q`.
- [ ] No stale claims survive:
      `grep -rn "streamable_http_client\|http is not supported\|only supports.*sse\|mcpCapabilities.*http.*[Ff]alse" agentao/`
      returns only intended matches (comments now describing history, none
      asserting current behavior).
- [ ] No lying docstrings: the three ACP files no longer say `http` is rejected.
- [ ] Smoke: monkeypatch `streamablehttp_client` to a fake 3-tuple CM and drive
      `McpClient.connect()` → CONNECTED + tools listed; if a real Streamable HTTP
      server is reachable, `/mcp add <url>` then `/mcp list` shows connected and a
      tool call round-trips. (`verify` skill.)

### Stage 8 — commit / PR

- [ ] Suggested commit: `feat(mcp): add Streamable HTTP transport; bare url now
      defaults to http` (conventional-commit scope, matches repo history).
- [ ] PR body: **BREAKING CHANGE** callout + the §10 migration line + a link to
      this design doc (`docs/design/mcp-streamable-http.md`).
- [ ] End the commit message with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- [ ] CI green before merge; if rebased, re-run the suite on the merged tree
      (semantic conflicts pass text-merge but can break — never merge red CI).
